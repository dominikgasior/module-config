# Module Config

A simple library that helps you validate configuration for a module.

It's really cool especially for devops as they can see which environment variables are missing - the library provides validation on the app start.

Additionally, it allows you to use it for different purposes, for instance for getting some config from an external service (thanks to abstraction).
